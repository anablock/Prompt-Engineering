# Summarizing

Summarize text with a focus on specific topics.

```py
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"): # Andrew mentioned that the prompt/ completion paradigm is preferable for this class
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

## Text to summarize
prod_review = """
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
"""

```

## Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit

```py
prompt = f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site.

backticks, in at most 30 words.

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
