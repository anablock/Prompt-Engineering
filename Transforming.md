# Transforming

Use Large Language Models for text transformation tasks such as language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.

## Setup

```py
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0): 
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Translation

ChatGPT is trained with sources in many languages. This gives the model the ability to do translation. Here are some examples of how to use this capability.

```py
prompt = f"""
Translate the following English text to Spanish: \ 
```Hi, I would like to order a blender```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

```py
prompt = f"""
Tell me which language this is: 
```Combien coûte le lampadaire?```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

```py
prompt = f"""
Translate the following  text to French and Spanish
and English pirate: \
```I want to order a basketball```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

```py
prompt = f"""
Translate the following text to Spanish in both the \
formal and informal forms: 
'Would you like to order a pillow?'
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Universal Translator

Imagine you are in charge of IT at a large multinational e-commerce company. Users are messaging you with IT issues in all their native languages. Your staff is from all over the world and speaks only their native languages. You need a universal translator!

```py
user_messages = [
  "La performance du système est plus lente que d'habitude.",  # System performance is slower than normal         
  "Mi monitor tiene píxeles que no se iluminan.",              # My monitor has pixels that are not lighting
  "Il mio mouse non funziona",                                 # My mouse is not working
  "Mój klawisz Ctrl jest zepsuty",                             # My keyboard has a broken control key
  "我的屏幕在闪烁"                                               # My screen is flashing
] 
```
