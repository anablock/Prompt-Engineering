# LangChain

User input + base prompt = Prompt Template

## Chain 
Achieve a specific task by linking multiple components together.

Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.
